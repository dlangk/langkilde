title: Risk and reward when turning tech into business
---

Technology and entrepreneurship are lifelong passions of mine. Most things have not been invented yet, and imagining all
the cool stuff we will enjoy in the future is a favorite past-time. But how do you turn new technology into valuable
products, and how is that related to risk and reward?

# Prelude

Insight comes from reflecting on our experiences. To understand my views on technology, entrepreneurship, risk, and
reward, a brief bio is probably in order. I knew already in high school that I wanted to be an entrepreneur (how that
happened is another story üòÖ). My strategy for how to contribute to innovation started with pursuing a degree with a
heavy focus on mathematics. The reason for picking mathematics was that I was _so_ interested in programming and
leadership that I figured I could learn those anyway. Mathematics, on the other hand, was something I needed help
learning. While studying, I made sure to be very active in various student organizations and non-profits. That gave me
an understanding of what it takes to inspire people to get things done, even without a salary (just like in a startup!).

Thanks to a great mentor I decided to learn a craft in my first job. In my case, I choose software engineering. Generic
careers like strategy or management consulting disconnect you from the reality of execution. Talking is easy, doing is
harder, and early-stage innovation management is largely defined by execution. Sure, you are likely to become a solid
earner if you pick consulting, but you are unlikely to learn or do anything game-changing. All you learn is to optimize
spreadsheets and ask questions. Not inspire people and provide answers. The only caveat maybe is that consultants make
good investors, so there is that at least. üòâ

After graduating, I was fortunate enough to get recruited by an early-stage technology startup that allowed me to
combine my interest in mathematics, programming, and leadership, but that also introduced a product and commercial
aspect to technology. Almost 15 years after deciding to start a business, it was finally time in 2018. Building a
company means my experiences in mathematics, programming, leadership, and commercial strategy are finally converging. So
what have I learned?

# Setting a Strong Foundation

Successfully turning technology into a business is incredibly complex, and involves balancing a very large number of
aspects. In my particular choice of entrepreneurship, i.e. enterprise deep tech, combining an intimate understanding of
emerging technology with a deep understanding of user needs is the starting point. I think whatever your vertical, you
have to be immersed in it to be able to succeed. You have to live and breathe the subject matter. Why? Because there are
so many opinions, and so much information, that the only way to find a path is to have enough intuition and integrity to
pick a path yourself. And picking a successful path means you will have to know what information to listen to, and what
to ignore.

Personally, I believe in the following playbook:

**Step 1. Look at the world and ask yourself ‚Äúwhat is inevitable?‚Äù.** I think for example that increasingly intelligent
machines are inevitable. I also think a radical shift away from oil is inevitable. There are lots of large shifts going
on in the world, and as long as you align yourself with one of them, you will be fine. If your company succeeds, you
will have to ride this wave for many, many years so make sure you like the wave.

**Step 2. Learn everything about the low-level details of your space and tech.** The key to early-stage success is being
extremely concrete. This is where most generalists fail. They have too casual an understanding of their domain. Learning
everything takes time. In my case, maybe 10 years. I worked patiently with the nitty-gritty details, trying to solve
problems, talking to smart people, and testing things. Rapid success is usually the result of very, very thorough
preparations.

**Step 3. Find something everyone is wrong about but that is necessary to get right.** True value comes from scarcity.
You will never make much difference if all you do is repeat what everyone already knows. Finding something that a large
group of people is wrong about is key to building a valuable company. For example, Tesla is built on the conviction that
a rapid shift to EVs did not have to take decades. Incumbents said, ‚Äúwe cannot move faster‚Äù. Elon Musk said, ‚Äúhold my
beer‚Äù. When we started Annotell, everyone said ‚ÄúComputers are going to replace humans‚Äù. I said, ‚ÄúNo, but with great
datasets, we can make computers a little less stupid‚Äù.

**Step 4. Provide a super-concrete solution that helps users get it right.** There is a huge difference between
interesting and valuable. There is only one way to really figure out if something is valuable: getting others to pay for
it. For some businesses, the first invoice takes a decade. For others, it takes two days. Sooner or later, revenue is
the way we define value. How much your margins matter depends on volume and position in the market, but revenue is not
optional. The only way to get top-line growth is to close the gap between a user‚Äôs need, your product, and their wallet.

**Step 5. Inspire a world-class team to rally behind your idea.** Without a great team, you are not going to make it.
The massive shift you are part of, what you point out is wrong, the solution you offer, and your passion as a founder -
all these factors have to inspire a large enough group of talented people to fight for your company.

**Step 6. Ensure excellent execution.** For all the big-picture questions you have to ask yourself up to this point, you
also need to ensure that execution is world-class. This becomes much easier with a world-class team, but even then you
need to ensure great management, clear expectations, well-defined processes, etc. Many entrepreneurs I know dismiss
processes as a ‚Äúbig corp thing‚Äù. Those people are unlikely to build a large and successful business. Growth requires
processes.

**Step 7. Map out your growth journey.** By now, you have the basics of a company. It probably took you many years to
get here. You might even have a few customers. It is time to estimate ‚ÄúHow large can this get?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat is the right
path from here?‚Äù. Weirdly enough, some entrepreneurs start with these questions before steps 1-6. Few such entrepreneurs
succeed in my experience. If all you care about is raising a huge round from a famous VC, then of course you need to
make very deliberate choices up to this point. But that‚Äôs not the only way to succeed, and it is not the only sort of
company you can build. This is where the risk-reward nexus comes into play. If you nail points 1-6 you will have a
company, and it is likely to make money. As an entrepreneur, you now need to ask yourself ‚ÄúHow much risk am I willing to
take when balancing the future value of my company, and my probability of survival?‚Äù

# Balancing Risk and Reward

The more audacious the proposed product, the larger the risk typically. Let‚Äôs say we _think_ we have found a radical new
way to generate energy, but that the capital expenditure required is multiple billions. Then we need to convince enough
people that our solution is in fact likely to succeed and that investing in you and your team is the best way to make it
real. The nice thing about expensive startups is that they are less likely to get a lot of competition. The bad thing is
that they are expensive, and hence financially risky.

All investors know this, but I wonder if all entrepreneurs know this? My point is that entrepreneurs need to understand
the balance between risk and reward when deciding to turn technology into products. Let‚Äôs look at a few scenarios:

Let‚Äôs say you have a great idea for a consumer mobile app, and it requires $5M to build a sufficiently good first
version to launch it, what are the risks? Of course, the largest risk is that you fail to convert the $5M into a
sufficiently good first version to attract users. Without strong usage metrics, you will likely fail to raise follow-up
rounds. So investors will evaluate you personally, and your potential. Usually, with these cases, the risk is mostly on
the execution side. Consumer markets are large, but the probability of successfully capturing a large part of consumers
is low. Smart, hardworking teams with the right pedigree are more likely to figure out what works, so they get more
funding.

If instead you have found a promising technology that might be able to change the way companies solve a big problem, but
you need $50M to make it _real_ _enough_ for a proof-of-concept, then what are the risks? Now the risks include both
execution, i.e. will you be able to turn the $50M into something good, and market size, i.e. is it worth putting $50M
into solving this problem?

As a founder, you have to ask yourself: what risks am I comfortable with? Typically, the larger the upside, the larger
the risk. A capital expensive start-up can weaponize money to dominate a market, assuming size translates into an
obvious advantage. The more scalable your business model, i.e. the lower the service fraction and the higher the overlap
between customers, the more money you need to defend yourself, but the larger you can get. Think search and social
media. Low-touch products that require huge amounts of capital, but where success lands you a money printing monopoly.

On the other hand, if your business model involves more service and more expertise, you are less likely to get
disrupted, but you limit your own growth. A smart, hardworking team can always make a specific customer happy. That‚Äôs
what consulting is about. It‚Äôs lower risk but also a much lower reward. Building a large company is about figuring out
where on the risk-reward curve you want to operate, and what you want to achieve - while still not compromising with the
playbook above.

# The World is not Fair

This risk-reward operating curve is also a big source of unfairness. Since so much of building a business is
speculation, trust and patience play a big part in overcoming challenges. If you have the right pedigree and network,
there is funding available that gives you time and freedom, or power, that others cannot afford. If you are not of the
‚Äúright‚Äù background, and cannot get access to such networks, the magnitude of your idea might not overcome the hurdles in
your way. Likely, this is changing as more money is available to startups and competition among venture firms increases.
But it‚Äôs worth reminding everyone that getting access to the unfair advantages that come with premium funding can be
significant. If you truly want to change the world, relationships and access are _as_ important as hard work and smarts.
Hopefully, if you work hard and build a strong track record, you will gradually be able to get access. If not for your
first company so maybe your second, or your third. So be patient.

# Living is also part of Life

I love working. I work more than almost everyone else around me. I‚Äôve built a lifestyle that makes that possible. I‚Äôve
simplified all aspects of my life to the extreme. It means I don‚Äôt socialize as much or have major personal projects. I
buy services for everything (cleaning, renovation, etc). I have a few hobbies (cooking, photography, chess, music) but
all are compatible with my workload.

My wife and I have found a balance after many years living together where we enjoy life. Balancing risk and reward in
entrepreneurship impacts your life in more ways than most people appreciate. So when navigating the risk-reward curve,
make sure to also ask yourself: are my choices compatible with my ‚Äúother‚Äù life choices? Many extremely ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù (
read: rich and famous) entrepreneurs have rather disastrous personal life stories. Divorce, mental health issues, heart
failure, frequent conflicts with loved ones. You name it. This is part of the equation, and those that dismiss this part
likely get a brutal awakening sooner or later.

# Conclusion

What is my point? My point is that you have to know yourself and know what you want, in order to make the right choices
for yourself and your company. There are so many variations possible, and there is no universal truth to what is ‚Äúbest‚Äù.
Is it more important for you to become a multi-billionaire than anything else? Well, then you need to accept a lower
probability of success, much more work, and a more narrow set of possible choices. If you prefer a higher probability of
success, then likely you are giving away some potential upside. It starts already when deciding to quit your job to
start a company. The choice with the highest probability of success is to not quit. But deciding to quit is just the
_first_ choice. Balancing risk with reward is part of the journey for entrepreneurs every single day.

Personally, despite all these challenges, building a tech company is the most fun I‚Äôve ever had!
