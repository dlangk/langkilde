I can't get this Don Valentine quote out of my head: "My biggest advantage as a VC was knowing the future." I've been
reading as much as I can about the formation stages of companies. A few thoughts recently:

- **The best risk-adjusted way to make money is probably not as a founder.** Being a founder is a high-risk, high-reward
  proposition. In a few rare cases, founders strike gold. But in most cases, it's years of hard work with little to
  no reward. To be a great founder, you cannot be doing what you are doing for the money. You have to be doing it
  for the mission. You need to be obsessed with the problem you are solving. And you need to find satisfaction from
  what you learn and the people you meet along the way.

- **Picks and Shovels.**

- **Platforms.**

- **Consumers.**

- **Market sizes are incredibly hard to predict.**

- **Brains or balls?** There is a famous quote in eBoys: "This is more a balls than brains business".

**- Your Market.** Is it big enough? Is it growing? Is it fragmented? Is it competitive? Is it regulated? I'm
starting to understand VCs obsession with TAM, SAM, and SOM. If you are successful, after a few years, your
long-list of customers will start to look like a short-list.

**- Your Crux.** The Crux is the most critical obstacle you can overcome with a focused commitment to action to
accelerate your mission.

**- Your Power.**
