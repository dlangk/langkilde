As a founder, your most important concern should be the obstacle you are overcoming, and the customers you are
serving. I try to focus as much time as possible on these two things. **What are we solving and for whom?**

But, in order to solve interesting and hard problems, you need to hire a team and potentially buy things. For startups
there are basically two main ways to get resources: turn a profit, or sell equity. You either sell goods and
services for more than they cost, or you sell shares. No self-respecting bank would lend money to an untested
startup. And you probably shouldn't risk your own savings either.

**Turning a profit as a product company is hard.** It means you have to create a product that is valuable to someone
else. That usually requires an upfront investment in both **product development** and **distribution**. Services is
easier to get started with, but less profitable in the long-run (more on this later).

**Startups typically raise money by selling shares.** A so-called "funding round". Startup people can't stop talking
about funding rounds. Pre-seed, seed, series A and so on. If you decide to raise money by selling shares, you will
quickly discover that **the future value of your company** is critical. This is also pretty obvious: the higher the
future expected value of a company, the higher the current value of the company. The main job of an investor is to
estimate the future value of a company and compare that to the current price of shares. Given a set of share prices and
future expected values, the investor can start to compare the relative attractiveness of different companies. A rational
investor will buy shares in the company with the most attractive **returns profile**. A returns profile takes into
account several different things: how much capital can be invested, how much return can be expected, and how long it
will take to get that return. Long books have been written on the subject of investing, but the basic idea is simple:
the higher your annual return, the better.

This connects decisions you need to make as a founders. In order to raise money at favorable terms, you need to
convince investors that the future value of your company will be high. The valuation of your company today determines
your cost of capital. The cost of capital, in turn, determines how much and how fast you can invest in product
development and distribution.

Let's say we start from zero: you have no product, no customers, no revenue. You create a company
and offer angle investors to buy shares. How do you appraise this company? One way to do it would be to ask: "How much
do we think this company could be worth in 10 years if this team is super-successful?". From what I understand,
experienced early stage investors will almost exclusively look at one thing at this point: the founder. Will this
person persevere through the countless challenges that lie ahead? Will they be able to attract the right people
along the way? Will they be able to make the right decisions? Pricing at this point is mostly a function of
competition. If the founder has ten investors lined up competing to invest, the price will be high. The
counter-acting force is that the founder needs to put the company on an attractive equity journey. It's likely not
in your interest as a founder to maximize the valuation in every round. Ideally, you price the company so that you
can raise enough money to get to the next milestone, but not so much that you can't raise money at a higher
valuation the next time.

This introduces the next critical concept: **Enterprise Value** and **Shareholder Value**. Together with the **Cost of
capital**, these are the three most important financial concepts a founder needs to understand. Enterprise value is
the value of your company. It's determined as the price per share times the number of shares. The price per share is
determined by supply and demand: how many shares are available to buy, and how much are people willing to pay for
them? Willingness to pay is determined by the future expected value of the company. Shareholder return is the annual
return, i.e. the annual amount of money made, from holding a share. Returns come in two forms: increase in share
price and dividends.

The purpose of a company is to create shareholder value. If your goal is not to create shareholder value, you should 
find a different way to solve the problem you are focused on. You can start an NGO, or a charity. Or go into academia.

As a founder, this means you need to weigh the following things:

- The cost of capital at which you can raise money
- The expected future enterprise value of your company
- The need for capital

If you think you can convert capital into enterprise value at a higher rate than the cost of capital, you should 
raise. If not, you should aim to turn a profit. I think a lot of startup founders get this wrong. They think the 
goal is to raise and spend money, when in fact the goal is to create shareholder value.

Let's say you have a company that is growing at 100% per year. You generate $20M in revenue with a 45% margin. 
Should you raise money? The answer comes down to: will it generate long-term shareholder value? Is the cost of 
capital today versus the expected future enterprise value in favor or raising money?

This is a complex question without a simple answer. This post only scratches the surface. But I hope it gives you 
some food for thought. As a founder, you need to understand the financial concepts that drive your company. That 
said, the most important thing is still to focus on the problem you are solving and the customers you are serving.
