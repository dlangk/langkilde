title: Complexity, Intelligence and Anti-Fragility
---

Engineers and mathematicians (and CEOs) want to reduce the world to simple models. The pursuit of simplicity and
elegance is a noble one. I love refactoring code to improve abstractions and remove repetition. I get the same warm and
fuzzy feeling when simplifying a business process. The enemy of simplicity is complexity. I think understanding
intelligence requires a deep understanding of the difference between complex and complicated.

### Complicated Systems

Complicated systems include machines like airplanes, computer programs, and other engineered systems. These systems,
while intricate and detailed, can be understood through analysis. Complicated systems typically have a finite number of
states with well understood state-transitions. That makes them predictable and deterministic. Engineers love that!
Limited feedback loops, separation of concern, linear relationship between input and output. Complicated systems can be
analyzed and understood. That makes us feel we can trust them. Obviously, the simpler the system the easier it is to
trust, but complication does not generally prevent predictability.

Most of our academic training as children is focused on learning to solve complicated problems. Problems that are
deterministic and linear. "Read this book and then answer these questions". Tasks do not generally have dependencies or
unexpected feedback loops. This favours kids that have reliable storage (memory) and powerful compute (raw
intelligence). Fortunately, school also includes a social dimension through which kids learn about complexity. A gang of
teenagers learning to socialize exhibit all the markers of an interconnected, sensitive and non-linear system.

### Complex Systems

Complex systems have a number of characteristics that make them different from complicated systems:

- **Sensitivity.** Small differences in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes,
  often referred to as the "butterfly effect." Or my favorite: "The approximate present does not predict the approximate
  future."

- **Non-linearity.** The behavior of the system is not proportional to the input. Small changes can lead to
  disproportionately large effects, and vice versa.

- **Emergence.** The system exhibits properties and behaviors that are not evident from the properties and behaviors of
  individual components. These emergent properties arise from the interactions among the system's parts.

- **Interconnectedness.** The components of the system are highly interconnected and interdependent. Changes in one part
  of the system can propagate and influence other parts.

- **Feedback Loops.** Both positive and negative feedback loops are present. Positive feedback amplifies changes and can
  lead to exponential growth or decline, while negative feedback stabilizes the system.

- **Diversity of Components.** The system consists of a variety of components with different properties and behaviors,
  contributing to the overall complexity.

- **Multiple Scales.** Complex systems operate at multiple scales, both in time and space. Behaviors and interactions at
  one scale can influence those at another.

- **Decentralized Control.** There is no single point of control or central authority governing the system. Control is
  distributed across the components.

- **Robustness and Fragility.** While complex systems can be robust and resilient to certain perturbations, they can
  also be fragile and susceptible to collapse under certain conditions.

These are obviously terrible properties of a system if you like control and simplicity. Yet, anyone who has managed a
team or built a company or run a political campaign knows that society is complex, not complicated. Groups of humans
form complex systems. To make matters worse, a group of humans is a complex system made up of complex systems. And each
human body is a complex system with countless interconnected components, feedback loops and emerging abilities.

People drastically underestimate how complex our bodies and brains are. I've recently taken up studying neuroanatomy and
the first thing you realize is that talking about the brain gives you the impression that we process information in a
single place. We don't. There is the peripheral nervous system, the spinal cord, the thalamus, the hypothalamus, the
cerebral cortex and many more components. Each of these systems are complex chemical and biological systems in and of
themselves. Together, they form a dizzyingly complex web of dependencies. There is
layer after layer of fragile interconnectedness. Humans are easily killed because of all these dependencies. Small
errors in our genetic programming can lead to catastrophic disabilities. On the other hand, when it works, it's
marvelous.

Complex systems are usually not engineered. They are evolved through experimentation. Genetic mutation is the Original
Gangster (OG) of experimentation. Ultraviolet radiation
is [the reason humans are intelligent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrimidine_dimer) ðŸ˜‰. "Errors" are introduced but
turn out to be a better solution than the previously dominating
solution. [Startups are the genetic mutations](https://langkilde.se/post/2022-07-30-extraordinary-success-requires-betting)
of the complex system that is our free market. Founders like to think their skill is the main source of success but as
with all mutation there is
a [huge amount of randomness](https://langkilde.se/post/2024-03-27-untangling-luck-and-skill-in-business). Equilibrium
emerges temporarily, but as subsystems change equilibrium moves. And complex systems can operate far from their
equilibrium for a long time, making it hard to tell if the situation is stable or not.

The universe does not lend itself to prediction to such a degree that we can engineer highly complex systems. We
over-estimate our ability to predict and engineer the future, and under-estimate the amount of randomness. The
alternative is that we are not in control, which is uncomfortable to most humans. The computational cost of modelling
enough details to predict the future likely exceeds our available energy.

### Anti-Fragility

I'm a big fan of Nassim Taleb and his concept of [anti-fragility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility). He
describes Black Swan events, i.e. rare, unexpected events with massive consequences. Such events are possible because
complex systems are non-linear. If a complex system is shocked by unexpected information it can lead to cascading
failures and huge impact. This is true for the human body, our financial markets and ecosystems.

Taleb suggests we should design anti-fragile systems, i.e. systems that get stronger if shocked. Anti-fragility requires
redundancy and optionality as strategies to navigate complex systems. Decision-makers should bear the consequences of
their actions to align incentives and encourages more responsible and prudent behavior. Humans are anti-fragile in the
sense that we have strong incentives to look out for ourselves, we have many redundant sources of food and we are
adaptable to changes in our environment. You can throw humans into completely new environments with different
temperature, humidity and food sources, and a surprisingly large number will survive.

### Intelligence

How is all of this connected to intelligence? Well, I think intelligence is a form of anti-fragility that has emerged
through evolution as a defence against complexity. The human body, with its brain and nervous system, has increased its
biological market share since it is able to withstand shocks and get stronger from them. We have evolved the ability to
zero-shot learn complicated things while simultaneously fitting observations and experiences into models for vast,
complex systems. We are resilient, adaptive and fast-learning.

Our current form of machine learning is better equipped to solve complicated problems. Problems that require storage and
compute. The last few hundred years have promoted humans with good storage and compute. But those days are over now. We
have invented tools that can amplify our storage and compute, or delegate it all together. What's left to humans now is
handling complexity. Solving linear, deterministic tasks that require an analytical approach is rapidly becoming a
commodity. This commoditization of storage and compute has been ongoing since the invention of the computer, and is
exponentially accelerating. At one point, the ability to do arithmetics was highly sought after. Royal courts had
scholars that memorized large amounts of text. Harvard
had [human computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Computers). Today we all have a calculator in our pocket. Or
our watch. All analytical work is going in that direction. Crunching numbers, matching patterns, extrapolating trends -
all of that is becoming a commodity. If your job is to make decisions based on data, you are about to be automated.
Fortunately, that is not at all a threat to humanity. We did not build a dominant position in our ecosystem on
memorization. We built our position on the ability to navigate complexity. Lean into that.

**What is my point?** My point is that intelligence is not primarily about solving complicated problems. It's actually
about solving complex problems. Decision-making under uncertainty in unpredictable environment with a lot of
dependencies. Humans remain the uncontested champions of handling such challenges.
