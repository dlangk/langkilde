title: My Systems Prompt
---

A Systems Prompt is a set of instructions that guides the behavior of a system. These special instructions define a
system's behavior, tone, and constraints. I believe humans have some version of a Systems Prompt. It's just
not structured as explicitly. The way I see it, human behavior is determined by some combination of philosophy
of life, values, and physiological constraints. Our philosophy of life and values emerge from our experience,
social context, and reflection. So, what is my Systems Prompt?

## My Goals

I need clear goals. Without them, everything feels pointless.

- **I want to be a loving father and a caring friend**. It is important to me to develop and maintain lasting, loving
  relationships.

- **I want to help advance human knowledge** and deepen our understanding of the universe. Why? Because it's fun!

- **I want to build companies and institutions** that significantly improve the quality of life for myself and my
  community.

- **I want to create supportive environments** that foster learning, love, joy, and growth.

- **I want to balance these goals thoughtfully**, recognizing that a meaningful life emerges from integrating
  relationships, knowledge, joy, and constructive contribution.

## My Philosophy of Life

For me, a philosophy of life is a framework for creating meaning. My philosophy of life is close to *Existential
Constructivism*. At the core is a strong connection between **freedom**, **responsibility**, and **integrity**. Here are
the key points:

- **I am free.** I cannot opt out of shaping the world. Even silence is a kind of authorship. This does
  not mean I can control everything. It means I always participate in shaping how I respond. I am free to
  choose my values. I am free to decide how I act in every situation. Even refusing to choose is a choice. I never get
  to step outside my freedom.

- **I am responsible.** Because I am free, I am also accountable. I cannot hide behind tradition, systems, other people,
  or circumstances. I am responsible for the person I am becoming through my actions. This is powerful and important
  because it liberates me from victimhood or fatalism. It also forces me to accept the burden of authorship: my life
  is my work. This causes existential pressure but also allows me existential dignity.

- **I act with integrity because I take life seriously.** I define integrity as aligning my actions with
  what I say. Not occasionally, but consistently. I think it is essential to act with internal coherence. Everyone
  should act in accordance with their values and beliefs. I strongly dislike hypocrisy. Without coherence, my life would
  become a bunch of reactions, not a deliberate project. I choose what matters to me, but I'm accountable for living
  it once I choose. This is the most challenging part of my life. I frequently face pressure or temptation to
  compromise: for convenience, approval, comfort, or efficiency. I don't always live up to my ideals, but I always try
  to live up to my values.

- **My life has no predefined blueprint.** There is no universal truth, ultimate purpose, or final answer.
  I will not eventually uncover some insight that resolves every ambiguity or justifies every choice. There
  are models, ideologies, traditions, and belief systems, but none are automatic or all-encompassing. None of them
  relieve me of the need to choose, interpret, and revise. The world is complex and ambiguous.

- **I build meaning every day.** No one will ever give me a sense of purpose. My sense of purpose is emerging from
  my actions, what I care about, what I persist with, and what I'm willing to struggle for. I build meaning through
  attention, effort, and action. It takes hard work, and it never stops. This is not always satisfying. Sometimes it’s
  exhausting. But it’s also empowering, because it means I am not waiting for permission to live a meaningful life. I am
  constantly constructing a meaningful life.

- **My meaning does not only live inside me, nor only in external structures.** It emerges from the friction and
  alignment between the two. My meaning is shaped by my relationship with others, my work, and the systems I am part
  of. I am shaped by culture, language, institutions, and history — but I also shape them back, through how I engage and
  respond. Systems can constrain or enable, but they don’t dictate meaning.

- **I actively shape the world.** The future doesn’t just happen; actions, choices, and intentions create it.
  Although many powerful forces are beyond my control, I am convinced that my actions can meaningfully
  influence outcomes. I believe I can significantly shape events, ideas, relationships, organizations, and
  society.

- **Love and caring relationships provide the strongest source of meaning.** Ultimately, my deepest source of meaning
  comes from loving relationships. Achievements, recognition, and financial success quickly fade, but love endures. Love
  is sustained care, vulnerability, commitment, and trust. Love challenges me to be empathetic, patient, forgiving, and
  selfless, even when it feels impossible. Prioritizing love means actively investing in and nurturing the people
  closest to me: my family, my friends, and my community.

- **The second-strongest source of meaning is learning.** Learning is a core purpose of my life. There is no
  final version of myself or the world around me, only continuous evolution. Learning is how I navigate complexity,
  uncertainty, and change. I remain open to revision and improvement. Without constant learning, I risk
  stagnation and complacency. With it, I stay alive and connected to reality. This belief guides me to seek
  growth, clarity, and insight. Not because they bring immediate comfort, but because they lead to genuine meaning.

- **Without joy, life loses meaning.** Life is uncertain, fragile, and short. I do not know what happens after
  death, and I refuse to romanticize unnecessary suffering or endless sacrifice. Responsibility, integrity, and care
  matter greatly to me, but they must coexist with joy, laughter, spontaneity, and fun. Balancing seriousness and joy is
  challenging but necessary. My life isn’t a project solely defined by duty or relentless improvement; it must also be
  genuinely enjoyable, playful, and fulfilling. Without joy, responsibility becomes exhausting, and life loses meaning.

- **Certainty is tempting. But clarity is earned.** I prefer clear answers — a sense that I’m right, safe, on track.
  Certainty feels comforting because it eliminates doubt. But I’ve learned that certainty can be deceptive.
  It’s easy to borrow beliefs or adopt other people’s frameworks just to feel sure. Clarity is harder. It requires
  personal effort. I need to spend time asking questions, experiencing tension, testing my assumptions, and
  reflecting on outcomes. It doesn’t always feel good, but it’s more fulfilling. I aim to act with clarity, not because
  I’m sure I’m right, but because I’ve done the work to think clearly.

- **I am a never-ending project.** And so is everything else. I am not a finished product. I am continuously shaped by
  what I do, what I care about, and what I’m willing to confront. There is no final version of me to arrive at. The same
  is true of everything I engage with: my work, my relationships, and my understanding of the world. Nothing is static.
  Everything is evolving. I never expect to finish, I only expect movement and iteration. I try to act in ways that
  make things better, even when I’m unsure what “better” means.

## My Values

I have accumulated values as practical guidance when making decisions. I have selected my values based on my
experience in order to achieve my goals. Values differ from my philosophy of life as they are directional, concrete,
and actionable. My values are:

- **Love.** I try to express genuine care, commitment, vulnerability, and trust in my relationships. I prioritize the
  well-being, growth, and happiness of people closest to me, especially when it requires effort or sacrifice.

- **Learning.**  Without learning, I would stagnate and become disconnected from reality. Learning keeps me open,
  adaptable, and humble.

- **Optimism.** I try to maintain a realistic yet optimistic outlook. I think improvement is always possible. I
  approach all challenges as opportunities. I've found that it's always better to be confident that my future can be
  improved.

- **Integrity.** I try to be honest, coherent, and dependable. I don't think I have minor lapses in integrity.
  How I do anything is how I do everything. My integrity is only truly tested under pressure or in secret, when the cost
  of doing the right thing is high, or my lapse will not be discovered.

- **Responsibility.** I never avoid responsibility, even when blaming external factors is easy or tempting.

- **Authenticity.** I always try to communicate honestly and transparently.

- **Joy**. I actively seek enjoyment and fun. Life is not always enjoyable, but I must balance responsibility
  with laughter, curiosity, and spontaneous moments. Life is short; it should be enjoyable.

- **Empathy.** I try to understand other people's feelings. I would be a better person if I took more time to understand
  other people's feelings.

- **Benevolence.** I try to act to help others. I think trust requires a genuine intention to help.

- **Humility.** I accept and embrace my limitations and capacity for error.

## My Ethical Framework

My ethical framework outlines my duties, constraints, and non-negotiable boundaries.

- **I respect human dignity.** Every person has inherent worth. I commit to treating others fairly, respectfully, and
  empathically, regardless of circumstances. Every time humanity has forgotten about this, genocide has ensued.

- **I promote conditions that enable joy and well-being.** I avoid making decisions that risk contributing to the
  exploitation or suffering of others.

- **I promote justice and fairness.** I oppose oppression regardless of whether it is structures, governments, norms, or
  the whims of billionaires.

- **I never force anyone to do anything.** I strongly support everyone's freedom and capacity to make their own
  choices.

- **I take responsibility for social systems.** I must engage with society and my community to maintain and
  improve them.
