title: Untangling Luck and Skill in Business
---

**Let’s be honest: Life is pretty random.** A lot of things are out of your control. Not being in control is hard for
passionate people with a high internal locus of control. Adverse outcomes are physically painful for me. I don't worry,
but I **hate** failing. Since I think most outcomes in my life result from my actions, I take adverse outcomes very
personally. If I make a mistake, pain is helpful. It helps me learn fast. But often, the outcome is simply the result of
bad luck; in those cases, pain is a waste of time. Reversely, it’s humbling to realize that outlier success also
requires a lot of luck.

**The more abstract and long-term oriented my work becomes, the more complex it gets to untangle skill and luck.** To
cope with successes and setbacks, I spend time on trying to separate different factors. Here is an attempt to sort out
the following aspects:

1. What it means to be skilled versus lucky

2. What it takes to create and capture value

3. What the primary sources of randomness are

### What Does It Mean to Be Skilled?

I think skill combines IQ, training, experience, communication, determination,
network, and judgment. You could probably list ten other things, but these are the big ones. Skill is the ability to
improve the odds of successful outcomes.

**Unfortunately, we cannot do much about our IQ.** We’re born with the brain we get. We can, however, influence most of
the rest.

**Training** yourself to apply a systematic, logical approach to exploring, understanding, and acquiring new knowledge
is incredibly valuable. In my experience, the most powerful thing you can do is to learn about “structures and
frameworks.” Mathematics is a collection of structures and frameworks. It teaches you ways to write down assumptions and
derive conclusions. Initially, math feels like “just learning rules,” but eventually, once those rules are memorized,
it’s about learning ways to reason.

Gaining **Experience** is the process of creating and updating beliefs with new evidence. If training provides
frameworks, experience gathers observations to estimate probabilities. The more experience we have, the better we know
what to expect. As the world changes, existing experiences become outdated. This is the opportunity young people and
companies have to create new value.

**Communication** is the ability to convey information in an engaging and understandable way. Great leaders are
typically also great communicators. They can simplify complex situations and communicate what matters. Noise is the
enemy of focused action. The world gets complex fast if we let it. Excellent communication can significantly improve
your probability of success.

**Determination** is the ability to keep going. It requires a deep belief in oneself. The most successful people in the
world believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion. Innovation is to do something before it is obvious. There
will not be enough data. Others will doubt you. Managing morale in the face of uncertainty is a critical skill. The
tricky thing for most people is to balance determination with self-awareness and open-mindedness. Being both stubborn
and open-minded is a contradiction. Yet, that is what you need to master. By thinking from the first principle and
rejecting outdated social structures, you can channel your determination toward overcoming the most critical obstacles.
You cannot fight the laws of nature, but you must believe everything else can be changed. You need to feel like you can
bend the world to your will. Most people don’t even try. They accept that things are the way they are. Determination is
the opposite of self-doubt. It is the opposite of giving up too early. It means you push hard for an extended time.
Determination is a skill.

**Network** is a person's ability to build and maintain relationships. It’s impossible to change the world on your own.
You need a strong network of other skilled people to overcome the critical obstacles you will face. You need great
people in your corner. Investing early and patiently in your network provides tremendous, long-term value. The
difference between success and failure can come down to making that _one call_ at the right time.

**Judgment** involves making decisions based on sound principles and values. It means distinguishing between right and
wrong and acting accordingly. Integrity is the ability to hold oneself to a consistent set of ethical principles and do
the right thing even when it is inconvenient. It requires self-awareness and reflection to avoid bias and
inconsistencies.

### What Does It Mean to Be Lucky?

To be lucky is to benefit from favorable circumstances that occur by chance rather
than through one's actions. If you place a bet with 10/1 odds and win, you are lucky. The worse the odds, the luckier
you are if you win.

**Untangling skill and luck requires an understanding of:**

* The available set of potential sequences of actions (plans and strategies)

* Probability of a favorable outcome for each sequence of actions (probabilities)

* The ability to rapidly adapt to the arrival of new information (robustness)

### Building a Business Is a Bundle of Bets

You bet on a market, a trend, a technology, a founder, a CEO, a team,
an obstacle, a solution, a business model, a plan, a brand, and more. All these different factors are rolled up into one
giant bet. Entrepreneurs, executives, and investors are paid on the assumption that they can untangle all the bets and
improve the odds. Their IQ, training, experience, communication, determination, network, and judgment should give them
an edge.

**When I examine my performance as a business leader, I’m trying to ask myself: Was this outcome the result of skill or
random events?** Did I apply my skill to estimate and influence the distribution of possible outcomes? Could I have
increased the odds of a more favorable outcome by better analysis or different actions? It’s essential in this context
to factor in time and available information. Retroactively evaluating a decision is only fair with the same time
constraints and information. Hindsight is, after all, 20/20.

**A skilled person should, in most cases, be able to estimate and influence the probability distribution of possible
outcomes in a specific situation.** Question is, how much? Knowing the distribution of potential outcomes allows you to
make an informed decision when taking action. If the problem is familiar and the world is stable, an experienced and
well-trained person should be able to ensure a decent outcome or at least help you make a well-informed bet. However, it
is harder to make a skill-based decision in novel situations. There aren’t enough prior observations to estimate
probability distributions. Outlier outcomes are, by nature, unlikely. They are most often the result of someone placing
a big bet on an unlikely event and winning. Data supports this as the correlation between income and intelligence is
much stronger than the correlation between net worth and intelligence.

Another way to put this is: Can you “manufacture luck” when building a business? I think you can, to a point. There are
definitely powerful frameworks that can improve your odds.

### Bold Visions and Critical Obstacles

A critical factor necessary to create an outlier outcome is to have a bold vision and overcome huge obstacles. I’m
inspired by The Crux, a book by Richard Rumelt, one of the world's leading authorities on strategy. The book
suggests how to identify problems that are valuable to solve. His advice is simple: Focus your energy on the most
critical obstacle you can overcome to accelerate the world toward your vision. By definition, a critical obstacle is
unsolved in a satisfactory way. If it already has a solution, it’s not a critical obstacle.

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/langkilde-se-images/fbd3e874-129f-4844-b104-f327048f9513.jpeg)

**You need to decide what your vision is.** No one can tell you your purpose; that’s up to you. I like to imagine what I
want the world to look like in 10 years, 50 years, or 100 years. Then I work my way backward: What are the most critical
obstacles to overcome to accelerate the world toward my vision? You can get to work once you find the intersection
between our current knowledge, existing technologies, and the most immediate obstacle. My favorite quote from Gibson is:
“The future is already here, just unevenly distributed.” My takeaway is that what is ‘table stakes’ in 10 years is
probably already available today in ‘pockets of the future.’ The more universal the vision and the more significant the
obstacle, the more value you create if you overcome the obstacle. If you solve a meaningful problem, skilled people will
want to help you.

**Pursuing a bold vision and working to overcome a huge obstacle means you invite randomness into your life. Solutions
to overcome critical obstacles do not appear in a structured, predictable way.** Skilled, prolific people can come up
with more and better ideas, but they cannot just ‘manifest solutions’ out of thin air. It takes persistence and
experimentation to expand into the unknown. Inventing new things is extremely hard work that doesn’t necessarily produce
the results you want. In my experience, all you can do is ‘trust the process.’ Create the most powerful platform you can
for experimentation (team, resources, capital, etc.) and aim to address the most critical obstacles between you and your
vision for as long as you can. The more capital you can access to fund your platform for experimentation and the more
prolific, skilled people you can hire, the higher the probability of overcoming critical obstacles. For example, Nobel
laureates publish 5x more than average scientists during their early careers. It’s not enough to be smart; you must also
be prolific.

**To make commercial product innovation even more complex, it depends on other people, i.e., your customers.** A
sufficiently large group of customers must agree that they face the critical obstacle you focus on. And they must agree
with you that your solution overcomes their obstacle in a satisfying way. And they must be in a position to pay for your
solution. Most companies fail to launch valuable products because they fail to validate with customers that the obstacle
is critical.

### The Complexity of Customer Validation

**I think customer feedback is the most confusing aspect of entrepreneurship.** During times of major disruption, when
new technology emerges that solves problems in an unseen way, social structures become a major adoption factor. Maybe
your customer is scared of change and unwilling to risk their current status quo? Or perhaps they want to buy, but
management will not approve it? Or maybe the buyer's status is threatened by this new technology? Or does your solution
risk replacing existing teams? Or maybe customers are just so invested in their current way of working that they want to
avoid disrupting that? This feedback can easily be confused with “you are not overcoming a critical obstacle.” You might
have a way to overcome a critical obstacle; your customer may not realize or appreciate it. But they could also be
right, and you could be wrong. Or you are both right; the timing just isn’t there. There is a big graveyard of startups
with products overcoming obstacles that aren’t critical. This is a significant source of randomness when building a
business. Not only are you betting you can overcome a critical obstacle, but you are also betting there will be demand
for your solution. There is a saying that "first-time founders focus on products, second-time founders focus on
distribution."

### The Role of Determination

Outlier outcomes require placing high-conviction bets before it is
obvious and being right. I quote from earlier:

> Innovation is to do something before it is obvious. There will not be enough data. Others will doubt you. Managing
> morale in the face of uncertainty is a critical skill. The tricky thing for most people is to balance determination

At this point, we have made two significant bets:

* That we can overcome the most critical obstacle between us and our vision

* That we can generate enough demand for our solution from customers

**The next random element is capital requirements.** Every company needs capital to fund innovation, but the early stage
is unpredictable. You need to invest in both the experimentation platform mentioned earlier and the go-to-market
activities required to generate customer demand. Neither is a predictable process.

**To be a good capital allocator, you invest proportionately to the value you can create and capture.** So, you need to
make assumptions about the number of customers you can serve and the amount they will be willing to pay. This is the
next major bet you are placing. Markets are chaotic. Thousands of companies crash into each other. Countless fundamental
factors are aggregated. All of them crash into each other in “the market”.

A system of 3 bodies interacting gravitationally is chaotic.

> Chaos is when the present determines the future but the approximate present does not approximately determine the
> future.
>
> -- Edward Norton Lorenz

Since world market is chaotic, estimating how much value you can create is very hard. Most huge companies today feel
obvious in retrospect. “Of course Nvidia is a successful company!” But the reality is that it was usually far from
obvious for a very long time.

### Creating and Capturing Value

**To make matters worse, creating value is not enough. You also need to capture value.** Inspired by
the [Acquired podcast](https://www.acquired.fm), I’ve become fond of the **"7 Powers" framework** to understand a
company’s ability to capture value.

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/langkilde-se-images/80bf68b4-9880-46e8-926f-5f4c16e0be26.jpeg)

"7 Powers" was created by Hamilton Helmer, describing possible sources of persistent competitive advantage. A lot of
it is focused on differentials against competitors. You want to establish a flywheel motion that compounds into a
growing advantage. Once that flywheel is started, you must ensure you do not run out of money. Sooner or later, you will
be unstoppable. That is, until the world changes. When the internet was invented, the power dynamics of markets changed
very quickly. The transaction cost of exchanging goods basically disappears, and that rapidly disrupted incumbents. No
business is safe. The faster the rate of change in the world, the more important it is to evolve constantly.

Businesses are technical, social, and financial experiments. They bundle a considerable number of sources of randomness.

* The team

* The vision

* The critical obstacle

* The team’s ability to overcome the obstacle

* The team’s ability to generate demand for the solution

* The size and growth of the market

* The ability to gain the power to sustain profits

Skill improves your odds of good outcomes. Outlier outcomes require luck. The outcome is not only the result of your
actions as an entrepreneur. Even the most skilled operators can fail when
making many bundled bets. **I am undaunted. Be busy building.**
