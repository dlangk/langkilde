title: Complexity, Intelligence and Anti-Fragility
---

Engineers and mathematicians (and CEOs) want to reduce the world to simple models. The pursuit of simplicity andelegance is a noble one. I love refactoring code to improve abstractions and remove repetition. I get the same warm andfuzzy feeling when simplifying a business process. The enemy of simplicity is complexity. I think understandingintelligence requires a deep understanding of the difference between complex and complicated.

### Complicated Systems

Complicated systems include machines like airplanes, computer programs, and other engineered systems. These systems,while intricate and detailed, can be understood through analysis. Complicated systems typically have a finite number ofstates with well understood state-transitions. That makes them predictable and deterministic. Engineers love that!Limited feedback loops, separation of concern, linear relationship between input and output. Complicated systems can beanalyzed and understood. That makes us feel we can trust them. Obviously, the simpler the system the easier it is totrust, but complication does not generally prevent predictability.

Most of our academic training as children is focused on learning to solve complicated problems. Problems that aredeterministic and linear. "Read this book and then answer these questions". Tasks do not generally have dependencies orunexpected feedback loops. This favours kids that have reliable storage (memory) and powerful compute (rawintelligence). Fortunately, school also includes a social dimension through which kids learn about complexity. A gang ofteenagers learning to socialize exhibit all the markers of an interconnected, sensitive and non-linear system.

### Complex Systems

Complex systems have a number of characteristics that make them different from complicated systems:

- **Sensitivity.** Small differences in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes,  often referred to as the "butterfly effect." Or my favorite: "The approximate present does not predict the approximate  future."

- **Non-linearity.** The behavior of the system is not proportional to the input. Small changes can lead to  disproportionately large effects, and vice versa.

- **Emergence.** The system exhibits properties and behaviors that are not evident from the properties and behaviors of  individual components. These emergent properties arise from the interactions among the system's parts.

- **Interconnectedness.** The components of the system are highly interconnected and interdependent. Changes in one part  of the system can propagate and influence other parts.

- **Feedback Loops.** Both positive and negative feedback loops are present. Positive feedback amplifies changes and can  lead to exponential growth or decline, while negative feedback stabilizes the system.

- **Diversity of Components.** The system consists of a variety of components with different properties and behaviors,  contributing to the overall complexity.

- **Multiple Scales.** Complex systems operate at multiple scales, both in time and space. Behaviors and interactions at  one scale can influence those at another.

- **Decentralized Control.** There is no single point of control or central authority governing the system. Control is  distributed across the components.

- **Robustness and Fragility.** While complex systems can be robust and resilient to certain perturbations, they can  also be fragile and susceptible to collapse under certain conditions.

These are obviously terrible properties of a system if you like control and simplicity. Yet, anyone who has managed ateam or built a company or run a political campaign knows that society is complex, not complicated. Groups of humansform complex systems. To make matters worse, a group of humans is a complex system made up of complex systems. And eachhuman body is a complex system with countless interconnected components, feedback loops and emerging abilities.

People drastically underestimate how complex our bodies and brains are. I've recently taken up studying neuroanatomy andthe first thing you realize is that talking about the brain gives you the impression that we process information in asingle place. We don't. There is the peripheral nervous system, the spinal cord, the thalamus, the hypothalamus, thecerebral cortex and many more components. Each of these systems are complex chemical and biological systems in and ofthemselves. Together, they form a dizzyingly complex web of dependencies. There islayer after layer of fragile interconnectedness. Humans are easily killed because of all these dependencies. Smallerrors in our genetic programming can lead to catastrophic disabilities. On the other hand, when it works, it'smarvelous.

Complex systems are usually not engineered. They are evolved through experimentation. Genetic mutation is the OriginalGangster (OG) of experimentation. Ultraviolet radiationis [the reason humans are intelligent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrimidine_dimer) 😉. "Errors" are introduced butturn out to be a better solution than the previously dominatingsolution. [Startups are the genetic mutations](https://langkilde.se/post/2022-07-30-extraordinary-success-requires-betting)of the complex system that is our free market. Founders like to think their skill is the main source of success but aswith all mutation there isa [huge amount of randomness](https://langkilde.se/post/2024-03-27-untangling-luck-and-skill-in-business). Equilibriumemerges temporarily, but as subsystems change equilibrium moves. And complex systems can operate far from theirequilibrium for a long time, making it hard to tell if the situation is stable or not.

The universe does not lend itself to prediction to such a degree that we can engineer highly complex systems. Weover-estimate our ability to predict and engineer the future, and under-estimate the amount of randomness. Thealternative is that we are not in control, which is uncomfortable to most humans. The computational cost of modellingenough details to predict the future likely exceeds our available energy.

### Anti-Fragility

I'm a big fan of Nassim Taleb and his concept of [anti-fragility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility). Hedescribes Black Swan events, i.e. rare, unexpected events with massive consequences. Such events are possible becausecomplex systems are non-linear. If a complex system is shocked by unexpected information it can lead to cascadingfailures and huge impact. This is true for the human body, our financial markets and ecosystems.

Taleb suggests we should design anti-fragile systems, i.e. systems that get stronger if shocked. Anti-fragility requiresredundancy and optionality as strategies to navigate complex systems. Decision-makers should bear the consequences oftheir actions to align incentives and encourages more responsible and prudent behavior. Humans are anti-fragile in thesense that we have strong incentives to look out for ourselves, we have many redundant sources of food and we areadaptable to changes in our environment. You can throw humans into completely new environments with differenttemperature, humidity and food sources, and a surprisingly large number will survive.

### Intelligence

How is all of this connected to intelligence? Well, I think intelligence is a form of anti-fragility that has emergedthrough evolution as a defence against complexity. The human body, with its brain and nervous system, has increased itsbiological market share since it is able to withstand shocks and get stronger from them. We have evolved the ability tozero-shot learn complicated things while simultaneously fitting observations and experiences into models for vast,complex systems. We are resilient, adaptive and fast-learning.

Our current form of machine learning is better equipped to solve complicated problems. Problems that require storage andcompute. The last few hundred years have promoted humans with good storage and compute. But those days are over now. Wehave invented tools that can amplify our storage and compute, or delegate it all together. What's left to humans now ishandling complexity. Solving linear, deterministic tasks that require an analytical approach is rapidly becoming acommodity. This commoditization of storage and compute has been ongoing since the invention of the computer, and isexponentially accelerating. At one point, the ability to do arithmetics was highly sought after. Royal courts hadscholars that memorized large amounts of text. Harvardhad [human computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Computers). Today we all have a calculator in our pocket. Orour watch. All analytical work is going in that direction. Crunching numbers, matching patterns, extrapolating trends -all of that is becoming a commodity. If your job is to make decisions based on data, you are about to be automated.Fortunately, that is not at all a threat to humanity. We did not build a dominant position in our ecosystem onmemorization. We built our position on the ability to navigate complexity. Lean into that.

**What is my point?** My point is that intelligence is not primarily about solving complicated problems. It's actuallyabout solving complex problems. Decision-making under uncertainty in unpredictable environment with a lot ofdependencies. Humans remain the uncontested champions of handling such challenges.
