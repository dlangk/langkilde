title: Extraordinary Success Requires Betting
---

**Life starts simple.** All you need to do in school is to understand the instructions and execute them accordingly. Ifyou work hard, you succeed. Simple. The moment you leave school, everything changes. Suddenly, you cannot just work hardto be extraordinary. There is no definitive path to greatness anymore. Sure, you can get a job and do what the bosstells you, but soon you will find that you cannot achieve breakout success by doing what you are told. Instead, **youhave to make bets.**

### Valuable Tasks are Bets

When I left school, I was lucky and got an amazing first job at Recorded Future, working for a group of highlysuccessful entrepreneurs. They assigned me crazy hard tasks and pushed me to my limit. I am incredibly grateful forthat. But, there is one thing I wish I knew then that took me many years to learn:

**Most valuable tasks are bets.** This is particularly true when innovating. You assume something is possible withoutknowing for sure. Before realizing this, I was hesitant to take on really hard tasks. Or even worse, I inadvertentlytook on extremely risky tasks and suffered when I “failed”. It was grueling. I wanted to succeed and do good, but I keptfailing. Since I had no experience, I could not articulate why I failed, so I felt like _I was a failure_. I confusedtaking huge risks and failing, with _being a failure_.

### Communicate Your Bets Clearly

**Learn what sorts of bets you make and tell people upfront.** You can make high-risk bets, which typically come withhigh rewards. Or you can make low-risk bets, which typically come with lower rewards. Of course, most of the high-riskbets will not pan out. But that does not necessarily mean that the one making the bet is a failure. It just means theybet on something unlikely. Of course, skill and hard work can improve your odds. A task that is impossible for someoneis easy for someone else. In some cases, such as programming, skill has a huge impact. In others, not so much. Someclaim that ideas are worthless and execution is everything. My experience tells me otherwise. Some ideas have aninherent upper bound value that no amount of skill can overcome. That is why most great venture firms only bet on hugemarkets - that way, they eliminate the risk of the idea setting an upper bound for returns.

It would have been much easier if I’d known this in my first job. Instead of taking on crazy risky projects withoutsetting expectations, I could have said: “I have this crazy idea that might work, but it also might not. If it works,it’s super valuable. If it doesn’t, we won’t get any value except lessons learned. Can I go ahead with this idea?”. Ithink my superiors would have allowed me to test most of my ideas. High risk is not inherently bad, as long as everyoneinvolved _knows_ what sort of bet you are making (and preferably that there is a lot to win). If you are great atwhat you do and work hard but still fail, then just try again. And if someone calls you a failure in that case, justignore them.

### Boldness vs. Integrity

**I have struggled with the tension between making bold bets and being true to my word.** My instinct is to want to keepmy word and not exaggerate. On the other hand, audacious things are only possible if you take great risks. Day by day,I’m learning to make the risks of my activities clear while not letting that discourage me. It is not lying orexaggerating if you are clear about the risks. To get comfortable with this fact, you must realize there is a hugedifference between what is _possible_ and _probable_.

**I firmly believe that action shapes reality.** I expect the world to bend to my will. What we do and say matters. WhatI mean by that is: I believe my actions can significantly change the probability of something happening. The _probable_is what happens when no one interferes. The _possible_ is sometimes achieved when _someone takes action_. People toooften assume that things are normally distributed and beyond their control. They assume they will experience “the mostlikely outcome”. In reality, many distributions are heavily “right-skewed”. Or we can make them “right-skewed”.

For example, it turns out that global mean income is higher than the median, i.e. income is “right-skewed.” I think thisis because highly leveraged bets with huge potential upsides _sometimes_ pay off. In most cases, they do not, and those“failing” resort back to salary-paying jobs. Salaries are probably closer to normally distributed since they are upperbound by the amount of time you can work in most cases. While wealth likely begets wealth, most of it results from riskybets actually working out.

### Pursue the Possible over the Probable

**Huge value can only come from the unlikely.** In an age of increasing machine intelligence, efficiently doing what isexpected will bring lower and lower returns. Humans are not suited to compete with machines regarding memory,efficiency, or repeatability. To use a finance term, there isno “[alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_\(finance\))” in doing what is expected. You can, at best, replicatewhat everyone else is doing. Only those with the courage to believe in the _possible_ over the _probable_ will be ableto generate huge returns. So, learn to let go of your fear of failure and start betting.

PS. If you want downside protection, you can just learn how to program.   That way, you can always make a living. DS.
