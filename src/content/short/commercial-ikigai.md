title: Commercial Ikigai

Ikigai consists of the words ‘iki’ (to live) and ‘gai’ (reason) and refers to the importance of having a purpose inlife. Yes, writing about Japanese philosophy probably comes off as pretentious, but I’ve read so much about this conceptrecently that I feel I have to share. It started when I saw the amazingmovie ["Jiro Dreams of Sushi"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Dreams_of_Sushi). I got completely fascinated by theold mans relentless pursuit for perfection, and reading about him I realized how deeply rooted his way of life is inJapanese culture.

I think finding your purpose is as necessary for companies as it is for people. The world is a maelstrom ofopportunities and competition, and forces pull us in all directions at every moment. Finding purpose, and building aculture of joy around that, is necessary to thrive. So what does it take to find purpose?

### Three Pillars of Commercial Ikigai

**Focused commitment.** I am a devout believer in focus. I think a lot of the anxiety people and companies suffer fromtoday stems from an inability to focus and commit to a cause. I think it’s also an important reason once-successfulcompanies deteriorate and die. We see a world of endless opportunities and waste effort every day considering all thethings we could do, instead of focusing on doing _something_. Or we try and do too much, loose quality in what we do,and are killed by more focused competitors. Creating a successful life, and company, requires being obsessed with a veryspecific problem for many, many years. Access to information is both a blessing and a curse. We know about all options,which can be overwhelming. I recommendreading “[The Paradox of Choice](https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_the_paradox_of_choice?language=en)” by BarrySchwartz on this topic. While freedom and autonomy are critical to our well-being, limiting our options and imposing asort of “voluntary simplicity” can reduce anxiety.

**Craftsmanship and a state of flow.** One of the most powerful things with focus is the flow that it enables. When acompany, team, or person can focus on something that they enjoy, that is needed, and that they can get paid for, theyare radically more productive, not to mention happier. A company that tries to do too many things will fail in a worldwhere there is no second place. They will waste time constantly switching from one thing to another. Only the bestproduct survives global competition, and that takes focused craftsmanship.

**Excellence in everything.** Focused teams that strive for excellence in everything they do accumulate enormousmomentum over time. As a company, you have to be willing to spend on excellence. You need to invest in the most talentedindividuals, the best tools, the best environment, the best training, and the highest engineering velocity. The momentyou start compromising, more focused competitors will crush you. Not to mention that mastering a craft can be verysatisfying.

### Why is Focus Hard?

Most engineers I know would love to work according to these three principles. So why aren’t more companies organizedthis way if it’s so great? I see three main forces that tug at the attention of product teams:

**Market size.** The risk with focus is that you limit the financial potential of what you, or your company, is doing. Aparticular product will only warrant investment proportional to the potential value of its market. Some products havehuge markets and merit massive investments. Others have smaller markets and lead to smaller companies and investments.It’s similar to personal skills. Getting a PhD narrows your “skill market size” but allows for deeper focus. It’stempting to search for ways to increase the potential market for a product you are working on, but this only makes senseif you can maintain quality - or you might end up losing the foothold you already have. On the other hand, a competitorwith a significantly larger scope might be able to outspend you so much that they win anyway. Herein lies the hardestpart of building a successful business; it has to be large enough to be strong but focused enough to be the best, andall of this while moving extremely fast. Most companies will be tempted to grow a bit more at the expense of quality.

**Timing and network effects.** Speed is critical in today’s market. A great product might be launched too early, andfail because there isn’t enough need for it. Or too late when everyone has already found a different solution. Switchingcosts create significant hurdles, even if the alternative is much better than what you have. Timing is closely relatedto network effects. It doesn’t matter if you are building a great social network today unless you can somehow geteveryone onto that platform. Machine learning has similar traits, where the one with the most data can outcompeteeveryone else by better automation. That means attention to detail and quality might not be something companies canafford without missing their chance at a market.

**Disruption and experimentation.** Another concern I hear about focus is that you might get blinded-sided by unexpectedshifts in society or technology. Personally I think this is a misconception. True craftsmanship includes constantlysearching for better ways to solve the problem you are focused on, and constantly reading about the latest developmentin your domain. While you have to commit to certain solutions for enough time to transform them into high-qualityproducts, you should always experiment with the next generation of products. And be ready to let go of outdatedsolutions quickly.

### Conclusion

Search for a problem that is valuable enough to solve to warrant a lot of work, and focus on that for many years. Learnto enjoy that problem and use it to hone your skills. I’ve found that this brings me a sense of calm and happiness. Andas far as I can tell it makes a good basis for a company too.
