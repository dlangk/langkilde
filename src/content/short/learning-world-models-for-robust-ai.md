title: Learning World Models for Robust AI
---

**I recently declared that I’m [more excited than worried](https://langkilde.se/blog/why-i-am-excited-about-ai/) about recent progress in AI! 🚀** The main reason is my belief that there is a low near-term probability of self-improving AI. I cannot convince myself that asymptotic self-improvement is imminent. That said, I cannot dismiss the potentially catastrophic impact of a runaway scenario; I just think it’s still a long way off. While the short-term disruption caused by new AI technology might be significant, I think it will be manageable. Assuming self-improvement does not kick in, the benefits of AI massively outweigh the downsides. Part of arriving at this conclusion is the incredible complexity involved in creating embodied AI capable of independent self-improvement. I’ve taken time this summer to read various suggestions of how embodied AI might be made real, and I want to share some thoughts.

## Learning World Models

**I think a “world model” is necessary for robust intelligence.** I’ve read most of the recent papers by Yann LeCun, and I tend to agree with his position that models need “[grounding](v).” He points out that all known machine learningtechniques are inferior even to simple animals with respect to their learning efficiency. Supervised learning (SL)methods require vast amounts of labels, reinforcement learning (RL) methods require insane amounts of trials, andself-supervised learning (SSL) requires an enormous amount of unlabeled samples. Our current auto-regressive languagemodels are no different. Language models require massive amounts of text for their self-supervised learning to findefficient representations that allow human-like token predictions. Animals and humans, on the other hand, can learn veryquickly, we can reason and plan, and we understand how the world works. How is that possible?

## Representing Reality

For the sake of this post, assume that we all operate in a shared, objective reality. We observe this reality by sensingobjects in space and tracking them through time. The photons that hit our retinas are translated into electrical signalsthat flow through our brains. Out the other end comes nerve signals telling our bodies to move. How the brain works isstill a mystery, but we can build a world model to predict the future and plan our actions. How is our world modelcreated, and how does it work?

I think there exists “**natural concepts** ” that are universal across languages and cultures. These concepts aredistilled representations of objects, their relationships, and the patterns by which they interact. We start formingthese concepts very early on. We learn that every source of light, sound, and touch in the world has a distance from us.Parallax motion makes depth obvious, making the notion of objects appear and the fact that objects can occlude moredistant ones. Once established, objects can be automatically assigned to broad categories as a function of theirappearance or behavior. At first, these categories are blurry, but the more context that has been gathered, the morecrips the ontology becomes. On top of the notion of objects comes the knowledge that objects do not spontaneouslyappear, disappear, change shape, or teleport: they move smoothly and can only be in one place at any time. Once suchconcepts are acquired, it becomes easy to learn that some objects are static, some have predictable trajectories (inanimate objects), some behave in somewhat unpredictable ways (collective phenomena like water, sand, tree leaves inthe wind, etc.), and some seem to obey different rules (animate objects like people). Notions of intuitive physics suchas stability, gravity, inertia, and others will eventually emerge. The effect of animate objects on the world (includingthe effects of the subject’s actions) can be used to deduce cause-and-effect relationships, on top of which linguisticand social knowledge can be acquired.

**The cool thing about humans is that we can learn enormous amounts of background knowledge about how the world worksthrough observation.** We need very few interactions in a task-independent, unsupervised way and yet extract relevantthings**.** We are not just stumbling around in the world. Instead, we accumulate knowledge in a “**world model**.” Wecould think of this as common sense. Humans use common sense to inform themselves about what is likely, possible, andimpossible. We have knowledge of physics, social interactions, and society that we use to predict outcomes and avoidmistakes. Common sense helps us fill in missing information and make us able to handle novel situations. It helps usrobustly interpret what we sense and ensure we do not suffer catastrophic failures of perception.

While most of the human experience is virtual today, we inform our world model through **perceptual experiences**. Incontemporary philosophy, perception roughly means what is conveyed to the subject by her perceptual experience, i.e.,the [phenomenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_\(philosophy\)) of an experience is what it is like forthe subject to have it. At any given point in time, healthy humans typically have experiences in all of the five sensingmodalities, along with [proprioceptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception) experience. The boundaries betweenour sensing modalities can be hard to draw, which is probably a hint.

People have thought about **how we transform our perceptual experiences into mental states** since the days ofAristotle. There is, for example, The Representational Theory of Mind (RTM) (or Computational Theory of Mind). RTM takesas its starting point commonsense mental states, such as thoughts, beliefs, desires, and perceptions. Such states aresaid to have “intentionality” – they are _about_ or _refer_ _to_ things and may be evaluated with respect to propertieslike consistency, truth, appropriateness, and accuracy. “A ripe strawberry is red is accurate,” or “George Washingtonwith dreadlocks is inaccurate.” RTM understands mental processes such as thinking and reasoning as sequences ofintentional mental states. To infer a proposition _q_ from the propositions _p_ and _if p then q_ is to have a sequenceof thoughts of the form _p, if p then q, q._ Recent debates about mental representation have centered aroundpropositional attitudes (beliefs, desires, etc.), the determination of their contents, and the existence of phenomenalproperties and their relation to the content of thought and perceptual experience. Or put more simply: how is what weare experiencing and thinking interacting with our beliefs and desires?

Some assume that mental representations come in two primary varieties. There are those, such as thoughts, that arecomposed of concepts and have no “qualia” (“what-it’s-like”), and those, such as sensations, that reversely havephenomenal features but no concepts. Famous thinkers like Aristotle, Locke, and Hume seem to assume that non-conceptualrepresentations are the only mental representations. Others, like Wittgenstein, argue that lack of generality,ambiguity, and their unsuitability to function as logical or mathematical concepts means no theory of mind can workwith only non-conceptual representations.

Regardless of what theory of mental representation you subscribe to, I know from my subjective conscious experience thatI see things that cause updates to my world model. This ability, and the efficiency by which humans incorporate newinformation into our world model, is central to our versatile intelligence. I’m personally mainly focused on **EmbodiedAI** (as opposed to, e.g., virtual, text-based language models). To quote theMIT [CSAIL Embodied Intelligence lab](https://ei.csail.mit.edu), Embodied AI is focused on _“understanding the nature ofintelligent behavior in the physical world through studying human intelligence and designing and implementingintelligent robots. [This requires] expertise in perception, sensing, language, learning, and planning, and [we] aim tointegrate these disciplines to make physical agents with human-like intelligence.”_ Most of today’s autonomous agents (robots, AVs, etc.) have a technology stack that consists of three main parts: **perception** , **prediction,** and **planning**. For each of these layers, scientists and engineers are working on using machine learning techniques likesupervised learning (SL), self-supervised learning (SSL), and reinforcement learning (RL) to teach algorithms to behavewell.

I imagine two interacting processes: 1) **Forming concepts** and 2) **Predicting the future**. Human success comes downto our ability to predict the future based on our actions. The more intelligent, the better humans predict the future,even when faced with novel situations or limited data.

So far, engineers designing autonomous systems have **isolated perception** into a specific step. Engineers have focusedon training systems to see where everything is located and assign objects properties like “this is a car.” Supervisedlearning is the most prevalent method, and some companies spend millions of dollars on labeling tens of millions ofimages to train neural networks to make predictions consistent with said labels. This approach has several **severelimitations** , a critical one being the **need for an agreed-upon ontology of the world** by which you labelinformation. Even if we can somehow agree on an ontology, that ontology also needs to result in labels that carry enoughinformation such that later stages of the pipeline can predict the future based on the labels. As it turns out, **humansare not good at describing** **the world explicitly** **in ways that allow predictions of the future**. Whateverrepresentation we hack together leaves out too many relevant things. Most of the “distillation of perception” happensunconsciously. When we are forced to try and make it explicit we underestimate how much subtlety we take into accountwhen viewing the world. Hinton has observed that:

> _The brain has about 10^14 synapses and we only live for about 10^9 seconds. So we have a lot more parameters thandata. This motivates the idea that we most do a lot of unsupervised learning since the perceptual input is the onlyplace we can get 10^5 dimensions of constraints per second._

The biological body is so complex and has 10,000 to 100,000 sensors distributed throughout that this alone makes everysingle millisecond of our lives a potentially unique experience. Combine that with the fact that we have on the order of100.000s or more muscle fiber units with a massive number of possible mechanical configurations. This means the brain isdesigned to handle unexpected events constantly. There is very little repetition if details are considered. Besides,there is also the problem that the world is only partially observable and partially predictable. Even if we assume theworld is deterministic, there is still the issue that small perturbations of initial states of nonlinear systems cancause massive differences in later states. As a result, **whatever world model we create needs to be built around theassumption that almost nothing ever happens. At least not twice.**

**Every aspect of a robust world model needs to be learned from experience and interaction to solve this.** Putdifferently, our world model must be a fully differentiable end-to-end model. The world model is optimized to allow thebest possible prediction of the future as measured by our ability to maximize some reward function. This would meanmerging the perception, prediction, and planning steps into an end-to-end differentiable model. When the development ofautomated mobility took off about 15 years ago, this was impossible. As a result, a “divide-and-conquer” method wasapplied. Also, many people insist an explicit intermediate representation is required to validate systems. That’s a poorexcuse not to pursue an end-to-end differentiable approach. There will always be ways to decode a latent model intosomething that can be inspected, and unit tests can be designed to test safety-critical aspects of the model.

## A Possible Architecture for Robust Embodied AI

LeCun outlines an end-to-end approach in his positionpaper, “[A Path Towards Autonomous Machine Intelligence](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf). He proposes afoundational architecture for achieving this form of efficient learning with six components: Configurator, Perception,World Model, Cost, Memory, and Actor.

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/langkilde-se-images/a50357bb-ad01-483a-b785-5a14ba186f41.jpeg)

The idea is that a **Configurator** interacts with all modules by modulating their parameters and attention circuits,i.e., priming them for a particular goal. The **Perception** module receives signals from sensors and estimates thecurrent state of the world. Since only a small subset of the perceived state of the world is relevant and valuable, theconfigurator will prime the perception system to extract the relevant information from the percept for the task at hand.The **World Model module then has two roles: (1) estimate the missing information about the state of the world notprovided by perception, (2) predict plausible future states of the world.** This world model needs to be learnedentirely, i.e., completely differentiable. It needs to consider both the untouched evolution of the world and futurestates resulting from a sequence of actions proposed by the actor module. Predictions are performed within an abstractrepresentation space**** containing information relevant to the task. A key issue is that the world model needs to beable to represent multiple possible predictions of the world state. The natural world is only partially predictable.Today, it is not clear how to (1) allow a world model to make multiple plausible predictions and represent uncertaintyin those predictions and (2) how to train a world model like this. The **Cost** module measures the level of“discomfort” of the agent. There are probably two types of cost: _Intrinsic Cost_ , i.e., hard-wired discomfort (thinkpain, pleasure, hunger, etc.), and _Trainable Cost,_ which predicts an estimate of future intrinsic energies. Both havesimilar purposes: to minimize the cost over the long run. The intrinsic cost determines the nature of the agent’sbehavior. The **Memory** module stores relevant information about the world's past, current and future states. Othersystems can query and modify stored states and costs. The **Actor** module computes proposals for sequences of actionsand outputs actions to the effectors. The proposed sequence of actions is sent to the world model, which then predictsfuture world states from the action sequence and feeds it to the cost module. The actor may comprise two components: (1)a policy module that directly produces an action from the world state estimate produced by the perception module andretrieved from short-term memory, and (2) the action optimizer described above. This would be similarto [Kahneman’s “System 1” and “System 2”](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/philosophy/system-1-and-system-2-thinking)thinking. Here’s an example of a “System 2” thinking process based on this architecture:

1. **Perception:** the perception system extracts a representation of the current state of the world. The cost module   computes and stores the immediate cost associated with that state.

2. **Actor’s first proposal** : the actor proposes an initial sequence of actions to be fed to the world model for   evaluation.

3. **World Model prediction** : the world model predicts one or several likely sequences of world state representations   resulting from the proposed action sequence.

4. **Cost evaluation** : the cost module estimates a total cost from the predicted state sequence, generally as a sum   over time steps.

5. **Actor's new proposal** : the actor proposes a new action sequence with a lower cost. This can be done through a   gradient-based procedure in which gradients of the cost are back-propagated through the compute graph to the action   variables. Complete optimization may require iterating steps 2-5.

6. **Actor sends actions:** after converging on a low-cost action sequence, the actor sends the first action (or first   few actions) in the low-cost sequence to the effectors. The entire process is repeated for the next perception-action   episode.

7. **Memory** : after every action, the states and associated costs from the intrinsic cost and the critic are stored in   the short-term memory. These pairs can be used later to train or adapt the critic.

## Predictions in Latent Spaces

LeCun is famous for his “cake analogy,” i.e., _“If intelligence is a cake, the bulk of the cake is self-supervisedlearning, the icing on the cake is supervised learning, and the cherry on the cake is reinforcement learning (RL).”_ Theidea is that humans leverage capabilities such as predicting and reasoning to infer the future from availableinformation. We do not just learn from explicit labels. “ _Prediction is the essence of intelligence_.”

The centerpiece of the architecture laid out by LeCun is the predictive world model. A challenge with constructing it isenabling it to represent multiple plausible predictions. The proposed **Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)**is part of solving this. JEPA isan [energy-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_based_model#:~:text=An%20energy%2Dbased%20model%20\(EBM,also%20match%20the%20data%20distribution.)self-supervised learning model that captures the dependencies between two given inputs, say _x_ and _y_. The specificbenefit of this approach is that instead of predicting _y_ from _x_ directly, we are predicting the latentrepresentation of _y_ that is most likely to follow _x_. This makes the approach different from generative AI modelsthat directly predict _y,_ and it is what unlocks the ability to represent multiple plausible futures.

By predicting in **latent space,** we can minimize the information content leveraged. This is desirable since the worldis only partially predictable. A direct prediction of future data, e.g., frames in a long video sequence, would beenormously resource-consuming. Humans do not predict every “pixel,” i.e., every tree leaf, the exact texture of thefloor, or how clouds will move. It’s more realistic to assume that we predict some lower-content representation thatignores certain irrelevant aspects of reality. This would be the world model. Four things are important to thisapproach:

* Make the representation of x maximally informative about x

* Make the representation of y maximally informative about y

* Make the representation of y maximally predictable from the representation of x

* Make the predictor use as little information as possible from the latent variable to represent uncertainty in the  prediction.

LeCun has, for example,proposed [VICReg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04906?fbclid=IwAR2jCTVpqrK8XCoQ1AXZue33NenZUoEhk7VVp6P8qpx4fpezuHvFV6jJUmg)as a method to do this.

## Latent Spaces and Reward Functions

The future belongs to self-supervised methods that observe large quantities of recordings to derive the most informativelatent representations for some reward function that requires you to predict the future. This means:

**The control problem is in the latent space interacting with the reward function.** If we want to understand andcontrol a system, we must understand the connection between the embeddings and the predictions of the future thoseembeddings lead to. If we want to ensure a specific type of behavior in a specific situation, we must ensure that thereward function causes the desired decision for a particular learned representation. As of today, there are no suchprogramming tools.

They will inevitably be created.
