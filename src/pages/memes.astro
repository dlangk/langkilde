        <h1>Memes</h1>
        <p>
            A meme is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a
            culture and often carries symbolic meaning representing a particular phenomenon or theme. A meme acts as a
            unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices that can be transmitted from one mind to another
            through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Memes on my
            list are copied from everywhere, as is the definition of a meme.
