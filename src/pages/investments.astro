            <h1>Founders are exceptional people.</h1>
            <p>They are prepared to bet years of their life to make something they are passionate about come alive. I
                love learning from Founders. Sometimes, when I meet someone really special, I invest. I invest if I
                think I can add value and make money.

            <h2>Lovable</h2>
            <p>
                I invested in Lovable because Anton Osika is the right kind of crazy. He is bold and pushes for a
                more aggressive, ambitious mindset in Europe. Anton and co-founder Fabian have what it takes to
                build something huge. Building "the last piece of software" is a great mission.

            <h2>Nyctea</h2>
            <p>
                I invested in Nyctea because I've been consistently impressed by founder and CEO Dr.
                Gustav Ferrand-Drake. Nyctea is on a mission to create affordable medicine by reducing the cost of
                production. Through his research, Gustav has invented a new method of biopharmaceutical
                purification.

            <h2>IntuiCell</h2>
            <p>
                I invested in IntuiCell because I was intrigued by its mission to reinvent the way machine learning
                works. It's a bold and crazy ambition. Dr. Henrik Jörntell has spent his career understanding the
                neural basis of sensorimotor control. His conclusion is that modern machine learning is based on a
                long-since outdated understanding of the brain.

            <h2>Motorica</h2>
            <p>
                I invested in Motorica because I think the best way to build value using machine learning is to
                create a unique dataset. Motorica's vision of "motion without capture" is a great example of this.
                Their dataset of human motion is unique and allows for very low-cost generation of human motion.

            <h2>Normain</h2>
            <p>
                I invested in Normain because I'm very impressed by Sara and Dennis Landfors. They have the
                experience, determination, and judgement to build a great company. AI is perfect for offloading
                boring work like compliance, auditing, due diligence, and sustainability. Normain aims to take AI
                from perfect in theory to perfect in practice.
