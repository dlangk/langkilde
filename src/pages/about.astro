                In my heart, I'm a programmer. By training, I'm a mathematician.
                By profession, I'm an entrepreneur. I'm obsessed with how things
                work — people, code, strategies, organizations — all of it. I
                break things down, overthink them, and put them back together
                better. My edge is that I'm relentlessly hardworking, addicted
                to learning, and (frequently irrationally) optimistic. I care
                deeply about building things that last: companies, cultures, and
                products with compounding advantages.

                Daniel Langkilde is a Swedish entrepreneur and machine learning
                expert, known for building high-performance teams at the
                frontier of AI. He is the co-founder and CEO of Kognic, the
                leading human-in-the-loop platform for sensor-fusion data used
                in autonomous systems. Kognic supports some of the world's most
                advanced ADAS and autonomy programs, helping machines learn
                faster and better from reliable human feedback.

                company’s formative years. Recorded Future became a global
                leader in threat intelligence and was later acquired by
                Mastercard in one of Sweden’s largest AI exits. Daniel has a
                long-standing interest in applied machine learning, automation,
                and scalable data infrastructure.

            <p>
                I live in Göteborg with my wife, Louise, our son, Isak, and our daughter, Elin. I've
                previously lived in San Francisco, Shanghai, and Boston. I'm
                fluent in Swedish and English, and speak basic Mandarin. When I'm not
                building companies, I enjoy running, photography, cooking, and
                hacking on side projects. Most of all, I enjoy learning — from
                books, from people, and from taking things apart to see what
                makes them tick.
