    "review": "The Crux is my favorite book on strategy. I always felt strategy was sort of a nonsense word. I associated it with overpaid McKinsey consultants (I despise management consulting and judge anyone working for such companies). But once I read this book I realized that strategy is just another word for thoroughly understanding problems. Rumelt argues that most strategies start with useless things like 'grow revenue' or 'increase differentiation'. These are obvious desires that in no way guides teams. Strategy is about searching for root causes. Rumelt argues that the best way to create value is to identify the most important, value-blocking obstacle (or The Crux) that you have the best chance to overcome with a focused commitment to action. His example with SpaceX makes it easy to understand: The Crux with space travel is that rockets are 'fire and forget'. If SpaceX can figure out how to build reusable rockets, the economics of moving cargo to space fundamentally changes.",

    "author": "Hamilton Helmer",
    "genre": "Business",
    "review": "What makes companies long-term profitable? Startups are focused on creating value, but eventually you also need to prove that you are able to capture value. The most valuable companies in the world today have established competitive differentials that allow them to capture value. Helmer argues that there are seven sources of competitive advantage: economies of scale, network effects, counter positioning, switching costs, branding, cornered resources, and process power. The book is a great reference for anyone looking to understand how to build a moat around their business."
