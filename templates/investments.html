        <p>I love talking to founders, learning about new businesses and exploring new technology. When I meet founders
            I'm really impressed by, or technologies I'm really excited by, I occasionally invest. I invest if I think I
            can add value and make money.</p>

        <p><strong>Lovable.</strong> I invested in Lovable because Anton Osika is the right kind of crazy. He is bold
            and pushes for a more aggressive, ambitious mindset in Europe. Anton and co-founder Fabian have what it
            takes to build something huge. Building "the last piece of software" is a great mission.

        <p><strong>Nyctea.</strong> I invested in Nyctea because I've been consistently impressed by founder and CEO Dr.
            Gustav Ferrand-Drake. Nyctea is on a mission to create affordable medicine by reducing the cost of
            production. Through his research, Gustav has invented a new method of biopharmaceutical purification.

        <p><strong>IntuiCell.</strong> I invested in because I was intrigued by IntuiCells mission to reinvent the way
            machine learning works. It's a bold and crazy ambition. Dr. Henrik JÃ¶rntell has spent his career
            understanding the neural basis of sensorimotor control. His conclusion is that modern machine learning is
            based on a long-since outdated understanding of the brain.

        <p><strong>Motorica.</strong> I invested in Motorica because I think the best way to build value using machine
            learning is to create a unique dataset. Motorica's vision of "motion without capture" is a great example of
            this. Their dataset of human motion that is unique, and allows for very low-cost generation of human motion.

        <p><strong>Normain.</strong> I invested in Normain because I'm very impressed by Sara and Dennis Landfors. They
            have the experience, determination and judgement to build a great company. AI is perfect for offloading
            boring work like compliance, auditing, due diligence, and sustainability. Normain aims to take AI from
            perfect in theory to perfect in practice.
