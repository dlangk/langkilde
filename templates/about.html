        <h1>Daniel Langkilde</h1>
        <p>In my heart, I’m a programmer. By training, I’m a mathematician. And I’m a manager of high-tech companies by
            profession. My most significant competitive advantage is that I am relentlessly hardworking, addicted to
            learning, and profoundly optimistic.</p>
        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>I live in Göteborg, Sweden, and share my life with Louise, my son Isak and our dog Alice. I’ve previously
            lived
            in San Francisco, Shanghai, and Boston. I’m fluent in Swedish and English and speak decent Mandarin and
            basic
            French. I enjoy cooking, photography, running, and coding.</p>
